## Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q: "How accurate are the predictions?"

**A**: "The forecast uses linear regression on the last 12 months of data. We include confidence intervals (±20%) to show the range. As we collect more data, accuracy improves. This is meant for planning, not precise prediction."

### Q: "What if we don't have milestone data for old events?"

**A**: "Great question! The system handles this gracefully. Legacy events show total downtime only, with a 'Limited Analytics' badge. As you add milestone data to new events, the analytics get richer. No migration required - it works with what you have."

### Q: "Can we customize the insights?"

**A**: "Currently, we have 8 built-in insight algorithms that cover the most common patterns. Post-MVP, we can add custom thresholds and additional algorithms based on your specific needs."

### Q: "How long does PDF export take?"

**A**: "Typically 8-10 seconds for a full report with all 16 visualizations. We capture high-resolution charts (300 DPI) for print quality, which takes a bit longer but ensures professional results."

### Q: "Can we filter by specific aircraft or fleet?"

**A**: "Absolutely! You can filter by date range, fleet group, or specific aircraft. All charts update instantly. You can also export filtered reports."

### Q: "What's the performance with 1000+ events?"

**A**: "We've tested with 1000+ events and maintain sub-3-second load times. We use progressive loading (priority-based), data sampling for large datasets, and client-side caching. Performance is excellent."

### Q: "Can we add more visualizations?"

**A**: "Yes! The architecture is modular and extensible. We can add new chart types without refactoring. Just let us know what insights you need."

### Q: "How do we improve data quality?"

**A**: "The data quality indicator shows your current completeness percentage. To improve, start adding milestone timestamps to new AOG events. The system will guide you through the required fields. Over time, your analytics will get richer."
